            <strong>Local Search Engine Optimization (local SEO)</strong> is
            <em>similar</em> to (national) SEO in that it is also a process
            affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a web search
            engine's unpaid results (known as its SERP, search engine results
            page) often referred to as "natural", "organic", or "earned"
            results.[1] In general, the higher ranked on the search results page
            and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the
            more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users; these
            visitors can then be converted into customers.

        <p>
          The origin of local SEO can be traced back[5] to 2003-2005 when search
          engines tried to provide people with results in their vicinity as well
          as additional information such as opening times of a store, listings
          in maps, etc.

        <h2 id="localsearchresults">Local Search Results</h2>
        <p>
          Local searches trigger search engines to display two types of results
          on the Search engine results page: local organic results and the
          'Local Pack'.[3] The local organic results include web pages related
          to the search query with local relevance. These often include
          directories such as Yelp, Yellow Pages, Facebook, etc.[3] The Local
          Pack displays businesses that have signed up with Google and taken
          ownership of their 'Google My Business' (GMB) listing.

        <p>
          Google Business Profile (GBP), formerly Google My Business (GMB) is a
          free tool that allows businesses to create and manage their Google
          Business listing. These listings must represent a physical location
          that a customer can visit. A Google Business listing appears when
          customers search for businesses either on Google Maps or in Google
          SERPs. The accuracy of these listings is a local ranking factor.

        <p>
          Major search engines have algorithms that determine which local
          businesses rank in local search. Primary factors that impact a local
          business's chance of appearing in local search include proper
          categorization in business directories, a business's name, address,
          and phone number (NAP) being crawlable on the website, and citations
          (mentions of the local business on other relevant websites like a
          chamber of commerce website).[9]
        </p>
        <h3>Local Ranking according to Google</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Prominence</strong>, <strong>relevance</strong>, and
          <strong>distance</strong> are the <em>three main criteria</em> Google
          claims to use in its algorithms to show results that best match a
          user's query.[12]
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Prominence</strong> reflects how well-known is a place in
            the offline world. An important museum or store, for example, will
            be given more prominence. Google also uses information obtained on
            the web to assess prominence such as review counts, links, articles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relevance</strong> refers to Google's algorithms attempt to
            surface the listings that best match the user's query.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Distance</strong> refers to Google's attempt to return those
            listings that are the closest the location terms used in a user's
            query. If no location term is used then "Google will calculate
            distance based on what's known about their location".
